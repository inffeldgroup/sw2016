Note: To ensure a great user experience the application is shipped with
some images. If you do not need or want to remove these pictures simply delete
them from your device after installing the app.

RandomPics Software Testing Details
-----------------------------------

We used external libraries and therefore, did not cover the code with 
our tests which was commited with these libraries. The relevant classes
for code coverage are in the packages '*activites*', '*db*', '*util*' and '*dailypic*'.
These classes have been tested to > 85% coverage, where the uncovered sections
are consisting of special cases and catch blocks which should not be reached at 
anytime, otherwise the app will be requested to shut down.
